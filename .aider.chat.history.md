#### install all the packages based on import streamlit as st  
#### import scipy.stats as stats  
#### import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
#### import pandas as pd  
#### import numpy as np  
#### import seaborn as sns  
#### from matplotlib import rcParams  
#### from io import BytesIO  
#### from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages  

I'll help you install all the required Python packages for these imports. Here are the commands to install them using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit scipy matplotlib pandas numpy seaborn
```

This single command will install:
- streamlit (for `import streamlit as st`)
- scipy (for `import scipy.stats as stats`)
- matplotlib (for `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` and `from matplotlib import rcParams`, `from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages`)
- pandas (for `import pandas as pd`)
- numpy (for `import numpy as np`)
- seaborn (for `import seaborn as sns`)

The `BytesIO` import is from Python's standard library (io module), so no additional installation is needed for that.
